# Local Customizations

To override a file in the volto package, add the directory structure and file
to this ``volto`` folder.  For example to override the Logo.svg file add the
directory structure `components/theme/Logo` and add the file `Logo.svg` to it.
After (re)stating the server all customizations will be applied.

To override modules from other addons, create folders with the addon name and
follow rules similar to the volto folder.
